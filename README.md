## Introduction
Sorting algorithms are fundamental to computer science and are used to arrange data in a particular order. This repository provides implementations of several common sorting algorithms.

## Algorithms
The following sorting algorithms are implemented in this repository:
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort

## Usage
To compile and run the sorting algorithms, use the following commands:

```sh
gcc -o sort main.c bubble_sort.c insertion_sort.c selection_sort.c quick_sort.c merge_sort.c heap_sort.c
./sort
```
